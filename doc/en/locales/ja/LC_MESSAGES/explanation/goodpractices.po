#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:10
msgid "For development, we recommend you use :mod:`venv` for virtual environments and :doc:`pip:index` for installing your application and any dependencies, as well as the ``pytest`` package itself. This ensures your code and dependencies are isolated from your system Python installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:15
msgid "Create a ``pyproject.toml`` file in the root of your repository as described in :doc:`packaging:tutorials/packaging-projects`. The first few lines should look like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:29

msgid "``pytest`` implements the following standard test discovery:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:47
msgid "If no arguments are specified then collection starts from :confval:`testpaths` (if configured) or the current directory. Alternatively, command line arguments can be used in any combination of directories, file names or node ids."

msgid "Recurse into directories, unless they match :confval:`norecursedirs`."

msgid "Tests outside application code"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:73
msgid "Putting tests into an extra directory outside your actual application code might be useful if you have many functional tests or for other reasons want to keep tests separate from actual application code (often a good idea):"

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:92
msgid "Your tests can run against an installed version after executing ``pip install .``."

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:93
msgid "Your tests can run against the local copy with an editable install after executing ``pip install --editable .``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:95
msgid "For new projects, we recommend to use ``importlib`` :ref:`import mode <import-modes>` (see which-import-mode_ for a detailed explanation). To this end, add the following to your ``pyproject.toml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:108
msgid "Generally, but especially if you use the default import mode ``prepend``, it is **strongly** suggested to use a ``src`` layout. Here, your application root package resides in a sub-directory of your root, i.e. ``src/mypkg/`` instead of ``mypkg``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:113
msgid "This layout prevents a lot of common pitfalls and has many benefits, which are better explained in this excellent `blog post`_ by Ionel Cristian Mărieș."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:120
msgid "If you do not use an editable install and use the ``src`` layout as above you need to extend the Python's search path for module files to execute the tests against the local copy directly. You can do it in an ad-hoc manner by setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:128
msgid "or in a permanent manner by using the :confval:`pythonpath` configuration variable and adding the following to your ``pyproject.toml``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:138
msgid "If you do not use an editable install and not use the ``src`` layout (``mypkg`` directly in the root directory) you can rely on the fact that Python by default puts the current directory in ``sys.path`` to import your package and run ``python -m pytest`` to execute the tests against the local copy directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:142
msgid "See :ref:`pytest vs python -m pytest` for more information about the difference between calling ``pytest`` and ``python -m pytest``."

msgid "Tests as part of application code"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:148
msgid "Inlining test directories into your application package is useful if you have direct relation between tests and application modules and want to distribute them along with your application:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:165
msgid "In this scheme, it is easy to run your tests using the ``--pyargs`` option:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:171
msgid "``pytest`` will discover where ``mypkg`` is installed and collect tests from there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:173
msgid "Note that this layout also works in conjunction with the ``src`` layout mentioned in the previous section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:178
msgid "You can use namespace packages (PEP420) for your application but pytest will still perform `test package name`_ discovery based on the presence of ``__init__.py`` files.  If you use one of the two recommended file system layouts above but leave away the ``__init__.py`` files from your directories, it should just work.  From \"inlined tests\", however, you will need to use absolute imports for getting at your application code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:190
msgid "In ``prepend`` and ``append`` import-modes, if pytest finds a ``\"a/b/test_module.py\"`` test file while recursing into the filesystem it determines the import name as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:194
msgid "determine ``basedir``: this is the first \"upward\" (towards the root) directory not containing an ``__init__.py``.  If e.g. both ``a`` and ``b`` contain an ``__init__.py`` file then the parent directory of ``a`` will become the ``basedir``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:199
msgid "perform ``sys.path.insert(0, basedir)`` to make the test module importable under the fully qualified import name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:202
msgid "``import a.b.test_module`` where the path is determined by converting path separators ``/`` into \".\" characters.  This means you must follow the convention of having directory and file names map directly to the import names."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:207
msgid "The reason for this somewhat evolved importing technique is that in larger projects multiple test modules might import from each other and thus deriving a canonical import name helps to avoid surprises such as a test module getting imported twice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:212
msgid "With ``--import-mode=importlib`` things are less convoluted because pytest doesn't need to change ``sys.path``, making things much less surprising."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:220
msgid "Choosing an import mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:222
msgid "For historical reasons, pytest defaults to the ``prepend`` :ref:`import mode <import-modes>` instead of the ``importlib`` import mode we recommend for new projects. The reason lies in the way the ``prepend`` mode works:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:226
msgid "Since there are no packages to derive a full package name from, ``pytest`` will import your test files as *top-level* modules. The test files in the first example (:ref:`src layout <src-layout>`) would be imported as ``test_app`` and ``test_view`` top-level modules by adding ``tests/`` to ``sys.path``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:231
msgid "This results in a drawback compared to the import mode ``importlib``: your test files must have **unique names**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:234
msgid "If you need to have test modules with the same name, as a workaround you might add ``__init__.py`` files to your ``tests`` folder and subfolders, changing them to packages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:252
msgid "Now pytest will load the modules as ``tests.foo.test_view`` and ``tests.bar.test_view``, allowing you to have modules with the same name. But now this introduces a subtle problem: in order to load the test modules from the ``tests`` directory, pytest prepends the root of the repository to ``sys.path``, which adds the side-effect that now ``mypkg`` is also importable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:259
msgid "This is problematic if you are using a tool like tox_ to test your package in a virtual environment, because you want to test the *installed* version of your package, not the local code from the repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:263
msgid "The ``importlib`` import mode does not have any of the drawbacks above, because ``sys.path`` is not changed when importing test modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "tox"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:274
msgid "Once you are done with your work and want to make sure that your actual package passes all tests you may want to look into :doc:`tox <tox:index>`, the virtualenv test automation tool. ``tox`` helps you to setup virtualenv environments with pre-defined dependencies and then executing a pre-configured test command with options.  It will run tests against the installed package and not against your source code checkout, helping to detect packaging glitches."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:284
msgid "Do not run via setuptools"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:286
msgid "Integration with setuptools is **not recommended**, i.e. you should not be using ``python setup.py test`` or ``pytest-runner``, and may stop working in the future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:290
msgid "This is deprecated since it depends on deprecated features of setuptools and relies on features that break security mechanisms in pip. For example 'setup_requires' and 'tests_require' bypass ``pip --require-hashes``. For more information and migration instructions, see the `pytest-runner notice <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner#deprecation-notice>`_. See also `pypa/setuptools#1684 <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1684>`_."

msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:303
msgid "In order to ensure that pytest is being used correctly in your project, it can be helpful to use the `flake8-pytest-style <https://github.com/m-burst/flake8-pytest-style>`_ flake8 plugin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:306
msgid "flake8-pytest-style checks for common mistakes and coding style violations in pytest code, such as incorrect use of fixtures, test function names, and markers. By using this plugin, you can catch these errors early in the development process and ensure that your pytest code is consistent and easy to maintain."

#: ../../explanation/goodpractices.rst:315
msgid "flake8-pytest-style is not an official pytest project. Some of the rules enforce certain style choices, such as using `@pytest.fixture()` over `@pytest.fixture`, but you can configure the plugin to fit your preferred style."
