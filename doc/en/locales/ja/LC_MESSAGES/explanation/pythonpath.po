msgid "``prepend`` (default): The directory path containing each module will be inserted into the *beginning* of :py:data:`sys.path` if not already there, and then imported with the :func:`importlib.import_module <importlib.import_module>` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:23
msgid "It is highly recommended to arrange your test modules as packages by adding ``__init__.py`` files to your directories containing tests. This will make the tests part of a proper Python package, allowing pytest to resolve their full name (for example ``tests.core.test_core`` for ``test_core.py`` inside the ``tests.core`` package)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:27
msgid "If the test directory tree is not arranged as packages, then each test file needs to have a unique name compared to the other test files, otherwise pytest will raise an error if it finds two tests with the same name."

msgid "``append``: the directory containing each module is appended to the end of :py:data:`sys.path` if not already there, and imported with :func:`importlib.import_module <importlib.import_module>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:37
msgid "This better allows users to run test modules against installed versions of a package even if the package under test has the same import root. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:46
msgid "the tests will run against the installed version of ``pkg_under_test`` when ``--import-mode=append`` is used whereas with ``prepend``, they would pick up the local version. This kind of confusion is why we advocate for using :ref:`src-layouts <src-layout>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:51
msgid "Same as ``prepend``, requires test module names to be unique when the test directory tree is not arranged in packages, because the modules will put in :py:data:`sys.modules` after importing."

msgid "Testing utility modules in the tests directories (for example a ``tests.helpers`` module containing test-related functions/classes) are not importable. The recommendation in this case it to place testing utility modules together with the application/library code, for example ``app.testing.helpers``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:70
msgid "Important: by \"test utility modules\", we mean functions/classes which are imported by other tests directly; this does not include fixtures, which should be placed in ``conftest.py`` files, along with the test modules, and are discovered automatically by pytest."

msgid "It works like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:76
msgid "Given a certain module path, for example ``tests/core/test_models.py``, derives a canonical name like ``tests.core.test_models`` and tries to import it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:79
msgid "For non-test modules, this will work if they are accessible via :py:data:`sys.path`. So for example, ``.env/lib/site-packages/app/core.py`` will be importable as ``app.core``. This is happens when plugins import non-test modules (for example doctesting)."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:87
msgid "If the previous step fails, we import the module directly using ``importlib`` facilities, which lets us import it without changing :py:data:`sys.path`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:90
msgid "Because Python requires the module to also be available in :py:data:`sys.modules`, pytest derives a unique name for it based on its relative location from the ``rootdir``, and adds the module to :py:data:`sys.modules`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../explanation/pythonpath.rst:93
msgid "For example, ``tests/core/test_models.py`` will end up being imported as the module ``tests.core.test_models``."

msgid "pytest will find ``foo/bar/tests/test_foo.py`` and realize it is part of a package given that there's an ``__init__.py`` file in the same folder. It will then search upwards until it can find the last folder which still contains an ``__init__.py`` file in order to find the package *root* (in this case ``foo/``). To load the module, it will insert ``root/``  to the front of :py:data:`sys.path` (if not there already) in order to load ``test_foo.py`` as the *module* ``foo.bar.tests.test_foo``."
