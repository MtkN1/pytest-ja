msgid "By default, pytest collects directories using :class:`pytest.Package`, for directories with ``__init__.py`` files, and :class:`pytest.Dir` for other directories. If you want to customize how a directory is collected, you can write your own :class:`pytest.Directory` collector, and use :hook:`pytest_collect_directory` to hook it up."

msgid "Suppose you want to customize how collection is done on a per-directory basis. Here is an example ``conftest.py`` plugin that allows directories to contain a ``manifest.json`` file, which defines how the collection should be done for the directory. In this example, only a simple list of files is supported, however you can imagine adding other keys, such as exclusions and globs."
