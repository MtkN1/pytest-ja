msgid "Ignore paths during test collection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:7
msgid "You can easily ignore certain test directories and modules during collection by passing the ``--ignore=path`` option on the cli. ``pytest`` allows multiple ``--ignore`` options. Example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:28
msgid "Now if you invoke ``pytest`` with ``--ignore=tests/foobar/test_foobar_03.py --ignore=tests/hello/``, you will see that ``pytest`` only collects test-modules, which do not match the patterns specified:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:46
msgid "The ``--ignore-glob`` option allows to ignore test file paths based on Unix shell-style wildcards. If you want to exclude test-modules that end with ``_01.py``, execute ``pytest`` with ``--ignore-glob='*_01.py'``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:50
msgid "Deselect tests during test collection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:52
msgid "Tests can individually be deselected during collection by passing the ``--deselect=item`` option. For example, say ``tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py`` contains ``test_a`` and ``test_b``. You can run all of the tests within ``tests/`` *except* for ``tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py::test_a`` by invoking ``pytest`` with ``--deselect tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py::test_a``. ``pytest`` allows multiple ``--deselect`` options."

msgid "Keeping duplicate paths specified from command line"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:61
msgid "Default behavior of ``pytest`` is to ignore duplicate paths specified from the command line. Example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:72
msgid "Just collect tests once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:74
msgid "To collect duplicate tests, use the ``--keep-duplicates`` option on the cli. Example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:85
msgid "As the collector just works on directories, if you specify twice a single test file, ``pytest`` will still collect it twice, no matter if the ``--keep-duplicates`` is not specified. Example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:99
msgid "Changing directory recursion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:101
msgid "You can set the :confval:`norecursedirs` option in an ini-file, for example your ``pytest.ini`` in the project root directory:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:109
msgid "This would tell ``pytest`` to not recurse into typical subversion or sphinx-build directories or into any ``tmp`` prefixed directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:114
msgid "Changing naming conventions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:116
msgid "You can configure different naming conventions by setting the :confval:`python_files`, :confval:`python_classes` and :confval:`python_functions` in your :ref:`configuration file <config file formats>`. Here is an example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:130
msgid "This would make ``pytest`` look for tests in files that match the ``check_* .py`` glob-pattern, ``Check`` prefixes in classes, and functions and methods that match ``*_check``. For example, if we have:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:144
msgid "The test collection would look like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:163
msgid "You can check for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between the patterns:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:174
msgid "the ``python_functions`` and ``python_classes`` options has no effect for ``unittest.TestCase`` test discovery because pytest delegates discovery of test case methods to unittest code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:179
msgid "Interpreting cmdline arguments as Python packages"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:181
msgid "You can use the ``--pyargs`` option to make ``pytest`` try interpreting arguments as python package names, deriving their file system path and then running the test. For example if you have unittest2 installed you can type:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:190
msgid "which would run the respective test module.  Like with other options, through an ini-file and the :confval:`addopts` option you can make this change more permanently:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:200
msgid "Now a simple invocation of ``pytest NAME`` will check if NAME exists as an importable package/module and otherwise treat it as a filesystem path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:205
msgid "Finding out what is collected"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:207
msgid "You can always peek at the collection tree without running tests like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing test collection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:235
msgid "You can easily instruct ``pytest`` to discover tests from every Python file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:243
msgid "However, many projects will have a ``setup.py`` which they don't want to be imported. Moreover, there may files only importable by a specific python version. For such cases you can dynamically define files to be ignored by listing them in a ``conftest.py`` file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:257
msgid "and then if you have a module file like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:268
msgid "and a ``setup.py`` dummy file like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:275
msgid "If you run with a Python 2 interpreter then you will find the one test and will leave out the ``setup.py`` file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:290
msgid "If you run with a Python 3 interpreter both the one test and the ``setup.py`` file will be left out:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:304
msgid "It's also possible to ignore files based on Unix shell-style wildcards by adding patterns to :globalvar:`collect_ignore_glob`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:307
msgid "The following example ``conftest.py`` ignores the file ``setup.py`` and in addition all files that end with ``*_py2.py`` when executed with a Python 3 interpreter:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../example/pythoncollection.rst:320
msgid "Since Pytest 2.6, users can prevent pytest from discovering classes that start with ``Test`` by setting a boolean ``__test__`` attribute to ``False``."
