msgid "Welcome to pytest-2.0.0, a major new release of \"py.test\", the rapid easy Python testing tool.  There are many new features and enhancements, see below for summary and detailed lists.  A lot of long-deprecated code has been removed, resulting in a much smaller and cleaner implementation.  See the new docs with examples here:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.0.0.rst:85
msgid "The usual way in pre-2.0 times to use py.test in python code was to import \"py\" and then e.g. use \"py.test.raises\" for the helper. This remains valid and is not planned to be deprecated.  However, in most examples and internal code you'll find \"import pytest\" and \"pytest.raises\" used as the recommended default way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.0.0.rst:91
msgid "pytest now first performs collection of the complete test suite before running any test. This changes for example the semantics of when pytest_collectstart/pytest_collectreport are called.  Some plugins may need upgrading."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.0.0.rst:96
msgid "The pytest package consists of a 400 LOC core.py and about 20 builtin plugins, summing up to roughly 5000 LOCs, including docstrings. To be fair, it also uses generic code from the \"pylib\", and the new \"py\" package to help with filesystem and introspection/code manipulation."
