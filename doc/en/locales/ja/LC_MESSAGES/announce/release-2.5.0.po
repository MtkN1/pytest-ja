msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.5.0.rst:4
msgid "pytest-2.5.0 is a big fixing release, the result of two community bug fixing days plus numerous additional works from many people and reporters.  The release should be fully compatible to 2.4.2, existing plugins and test suites.  We aim at maintaining this level of ZERO reported bugs because it's no fun if your testing tool has bugs, is it?  Under a condition, though: when submitting a bug report please provide clear information about the circumstances and a simple example which reproduces the problem."

#: ../../announce/release-2.5.0.rst:17
msgid "For those who use older Python versions, please note that pytest is not automatically tested on python2.5 due to virtualenv, setuptools and tox not supporting it anymore.  Manual verification shows that it mostly works fine but it's not going to be part of the automated release process and thus likely to break in the future."

msgid "dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself which means it's probably going to break soon (but still works with this release we believe)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.5.0.rst:47
msgid "simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved.  finalization is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the \"teardown phase\". While this might sound odd at first, it helps to ensure that we are correctly handling setup/teardown even in complex code.  User-level code should not be affected unless it's implementing the pytest_runtest_teardown hook and expecting certain fixture instances are torn down within (very unlikely and would have been unreliable anyway)."

#: ../../announce/release-2.5.0.rst:66
msgid "refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive anymore (it was tail-call recursive before which could lead to problems for more than >966 non-function scoped parameters)."

Examples: \"-k 1.3\" matches all tests parametrized with 1.3. \"-k None\" filters all tests that have \"None\" in their name and conversely \"-k 'not None'\". Previously these examples would raise syntax errors."
