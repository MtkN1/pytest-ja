msgid "pytest-2.4.0: new fixture features/hooks and bug fixes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:4
msgid "The just released pytest-2.4.0 brings many improvements and numerous bug fixes while remaining plugin- and test-suite compatible apart from a few supposedly very minor incompatibilities.  See below for a full list of details.  A few feature highlights:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:9
msgid "new yield-style fixtures `pytest.yield_fixture <http://pytest.org/en/stable/yieldfixture.html>`_, allowing to use existing with-style context managers in fixture functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:13
msgid "improved pdb support: ``import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()`` now works without requiring prior disabling of stdout/stderr capturing. Also the ``--pdb`` options works now on collection and internal errors and we introduced a new experimental hook for IDEs/plugins to intercept debugging: ``pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:19
msgid "shorter monkeypatch variant to allow specifying an import path as a target, for example: ``monkeypatch.setattr(\"requests.get\", myfunc)``"

msgid "allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail if a \"reason\" is also specified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:31
msgid "a new hook ``pytest_load_initial_conftests`` allows plugins like :pypi:`pytest-django` to influence the environment before conftest files import ``django``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:69
msgid "the pytest_plugin_unregister hook wasn't ever properly called and there is no known implementation of the hook - so it got removed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:72
msgid "pytest.fixture-decorated functions cannot be generators (i.e. use yield) anymore.  This change might be reversed in 2.4.1 if it causes unforeseen real-life issues.  However, you can always write and return an inner function/generator and change the fixture consumer to iterate over the returned generator.  This change was done in lieu of the new ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator, see below."

msgid "new features:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:81
msgid "experimentally introduce a new ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator which accepts exactly the same parameters as pytest.fixture but mandates a ``yield`` statement instead of a ``return statement`` from fixture functions.  This allows direct integration with \"with-style\" context managers in fixture functions and generally avoids registering of finalization callbacks in favour of treating the \"after-yield\" as teardown code.  Thanks Andreas Pelme, Vladimir Keleshev, Floris Bruynooghe, Ronny Pfannschmidt and many others for discussions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:90
msgid "allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail if a \"reason\" is also specified.  Rework skipping documentation to recommend \"condition as booleans\" because it prevents surprises when importing markers between modules.  Specifying conditions as strings will remain fully supported."

msgid "make \"import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()\" work natively wrt capturing (no \"-s\" needed anymore), making ``pytest.set_trace()`` a mere shortcut."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:103
msgid "fix issue181: --pdb now also works on collect errors (and on internal errors) .  This was implemented by a slight internal refactoring and the introduction of a new hook ``pytest_exception_interact`` hook (see next item)."

#: ../../announce/release-2.4.0.rst:118
msgid "fix issue322: tearDownClass is not run if setUpClass failed. Thanks Mathieu Agopian for the initial fix.  Also make all of pytest/nose finalizer mimic the same generic behaviour: if a setupX exists and fails, don't run teardownX.  This internally introduces a new method \"node.addfinalizer()\" helper which can only be called during the setup phase of a node."
