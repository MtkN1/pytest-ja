msgid "pytest-2.3: improved fixtures / better unittest integration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.3.0.rst:4
msgid "pytest-2.3 comes with many major improvements for fixture/funcarg management and parametrized testing in Python.  It is now easier, more efficient and more predictable to re-run the same tests with different fixture instances.  Also, you can directly declare the caching \"scope\" of fixtures so that dependent tests throughout your whole test suite can reuse database or other expensive fixture objects with ease.  Lastly, it's possible for fixture functions (formerly known as funcarg factories) to use other fixtures, allowing for a completely modular and reusable fixture design."
