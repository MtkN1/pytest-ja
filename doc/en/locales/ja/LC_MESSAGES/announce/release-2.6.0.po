#: ../../announce/release-2.6.0.rst:10
msgid "shorter tracebacks by default: only the first (test function) entry and the last (failure location) entry are shown, the ones between only in \"short\" format.  Use ``--tb=long`` to get back the old behaviour of showing \"long\" entries everywhere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.6.0.rst:15
msgid "a new warning system which reports oddities during collection and execution.  For example, ignoring collecting Test* classes with an ``__init__`` now produces a warning."

msgstr ""

#: ../../announce/release-2.6.0.rst:21
msgid "Note also that 2.6.0 departs with the \"zero reported bugs\" policy because it has been too hard to keep up with it, unfortunately. Instead we are for now rather bound to work on \"upvoted\" issues in the https://bitbucket.org/pytest-dev/pytest/issues?status=new&status=open&sort=-votes issue tracker."

msgid "fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default. The new \"--tb=auto\" option (default) will only display long tracebacks for the first and last entry.  You can get the old behaviour of printing all entries as long entries with \"--tb=long\".  Also short entries by default are now printed very similarly to \"--tb=native\" ones."
