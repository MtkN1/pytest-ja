msgid "**Important**: `py.code <https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html>`_ has been merged into the ``pytest`` repository as ``pytest._code``. This decision was made because ``py.code`` had very few uses outside ``pytest`` and the fact that it was in a different repository made it difficult to fix bugs on its code in a timely manner. The team hopes with this to be able to better refactor out and improve that code. This change shouldn't affect users, but it is useful to let users aware if they encounter any strange behavior."
