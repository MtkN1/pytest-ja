msgid "Controlling warnings"
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:50
msgid "Similar to Python's `warning filter`_ and :option:`-W option <python:-W>` flag, pytest provides its own ``-W`` flag to control which warnings are ignored, displayed, or turned into errors. See the `warning filter`_ documentation for more advanced use-cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:57
msgid "This code sample shows how to treat any ``UserWarning`` category class of warning as an error:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:82
msgid "The same option can be set in the ``pytest.ini`` or ``pyproject.toml`` file using the ``filterwarnings`` ini option. For example, the configuration below will ignore all user warnings and specific deprecation warnings matching a regex, but will transform all other warnings into errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:108
msgid "When a warning matches more than one option in the list, the action for the last matching option is performed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:114
msgid "The ``-W`` flag and the ``filterwarnings`` ini option use warning filters that are similar in structure, but each configuration option interprets its filter differently. For example, *message* in ``filterwarnings`` is a string containing a regular expression that the start of the warning message must match, case-insensitively, while *message* in ``-W`` is a literal string that the start of the warning message must contain (case-insensitively), ignoring any whitespace at the start or end of message. Consult the `warning filter`_ documentation for more details."

msgid "You can use the :ref:`@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` mark to add warning filters to specific test items, allowing you to have finer control of which warnings should be captured at test, class or even module level:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:150
msgid "You can specify multiple filters with separate decorators:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:162
msgid "Regarding decorator order and filter precedence: it's important to remember that decorators are evaluated in reverse order, so you have to list the warning filters in the reverse order compared to traditional :py:func:`warnings.filterwarnings` and :option:`-W option <python:-W>` usage. This means in practice that filters from earlier :ref:`@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` decorators take precedence over filters from later decorators, as illustrated in the example above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:170
msgid "Filters applied using a mark take precedence over filters passed on the command line or configured by the :confval:`filterwarnings` ini option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:173
msgid "You may apply a filter to all tests of a class by using the :ref:`filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` mark as a class decorator or to all tests in a module by setting the :globalvar:`pytestmark` variable:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:184
msgid "If you want to apply multiple filters (by assigning a list of :ref:`filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>` mark to :globalvar:`pytestmark`), you must use the traditional :py:func:`warnings.filterwarnings` ordering approach (later filters take precedence), which is the reverse of the decorator approach mentioned above."

msgid "DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning"
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:220
msgid "By default pytest will display ``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` warnings from user code and third-party libraries, as recommended by :pep:`565`. This helps users keep their code modern and avoid breakages when deprecated warnings are effectively removed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:224
msgid "However, in the specific case where users capture any type of warnings in their test, either with :func:`pytest.warns`, :func:`pytest.deprecated_call` or using the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture, no warning will be displayed at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:228
msgid "Sometimes it is useful to hide some specific deprecation warnings that happen in code that you have no control over (such as third-party libraries), in which case you might use the warning filters options (ini or marks) to ignore those warnings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:232
msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If warnings are configured at the interpreter level, using the :envvar:`python:PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable or the ``-W`` command-line option, pytest will not configure any filters by default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:253
msgid "Also pytest doesn't follow :pep:`506` suggestion of resetting all warning filters because it might break test suites that configure warning filters themselves by calling :func:`warnings.simplefilter` (see :issue:`2430` for an example of that)."

msgid "The test will fail if the warning in question is not raised. Use the keyword argument ``match`` to assert that the warning matches a text or regex.

#: ../../how-to/capture-warnings.rst:407
msgid "Both the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture and the :func:`pytest.warns` context manager return the same interface for recorded warnings: a :class:`~_pytest.recwarn.WarningsRecorder` instance.

msgid "For example, pytest will emit a warning if it encounters a class that matches :confval:`python_classes` but also defines an ``__init__`` constructor, as this prevents the class from being instantiated:"
