msgid "By using the ``pytest.mark`` helper you can easily set metadata on your test functions. You can find the full list of builtin markers in the :ref:`API Reference<marks ref>`. Or you can list all the markers, including builtin and custom, using the CLI - :code:`pytest --markers`."

#: ../../how-to/mark.rst:77
msgid "Unregistered marks applied with the ``@pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark`` decorator will always emit a warning in order to avoid silently doing something surprising due to mistyped names. As described in the previous section, you can disable the warning for custom marks by registering them in your ``pytest.ini`` file or using a custom ``pytest_configure`` hook."

#: ../../how-to/mark.rst:83
msgid "When the ``--strict-markers`` command-line flag is passed, any unknown marks applied with the ``@pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark`` decorator will trigger an error. You can enforce this validation in your project by adding ``--strict-markers`` to ``addopts``:"
