msgid "One might wonder why ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` instead of ``[tool.pytest]`` as is the case with other tools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/customize.rst:68
msgid "The reason is that the pytest team intends to fully utilize the rich TOML data format for configuration in the future, reserving the ``[tool.pytest]`` table for that. The ``ini_options`` table is being used, for now, as a bridge between the existing ``.ini`` configuration system and the future configuration format."

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/customize.rst:108
msgid "Usage of ``setup.cfg`` is not recommended unless for very simple use cases. ``.cfg`` files use a different parser than ``pytest.ini`` and ``tox.ini`` which might cause hard to track down problems. When possible, it is recommended to use the latter files, or ``pyproject.toml``, to hold your pytest configuration."

msgid "The ``--rootdir=path`` command-line option can be used to force a specific directory. Note that contrary to other command-line options, ``--rootdir`` cannot be used with :confval:`addopts` inside ``pytest.ini`` because the ``rootdir`` is used to *find* ``pytest.ini`` already."
